Given the root of a binary search tree and a number k, find the greatest number in the binary search tree that is less than or equal to k.

Examples:

 

Input: root = [10, 7, 15, 2, 8, 11, 16], k = 14

Output: 11
Explanation: The greatest element in the tree which is less than or equal to 14, is 11.
Input: root = [5, 2, 12, 1, 3, 9, 21, N, N, N, N, N, N, 19, 25], k = 24

Output: 21
Explanation: The greatest element in the tree which is less than or equal to 24, is 21. 
Input: root = [5, 2, 12, 1, 3, 9, 21, N, N, N, N, N, N, 19, 25], k = 4

Output: 3
Explanation: The greatest element in the tree which is less than or equal to 4, is 3.
Constraints:
1 <= number of nodes <= 105
1 <= node->data, k <= 105
All nodes are unique in the BST

Expected Complexities
Time Complexity: O(h)
Auxiliary Space: O(h)
