Matrix Chain Multiplication
Difficulty: HardAccuracy: 49.64%Submissions: 147K+Points: 8
Given an array arr[] which represents the dimensions of a sequence of matrices where the ith matrix has the dimensions (arr[i-1] x arr[i]) for i>=1, find the most efficient way to multiply these matrices together. The efficient way is the one that involves the least number of multiplications.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [2, 1, 3, 4]
Output: 20
Explanation: There are 3 matrices of dimensions 2 × 1, 1 × 3, and 3 × 4, Let this 3 input matrices be M1, M2, and M3. There are two ways to multiply: ((M1 x M2) x M3) and (M1 x (M2 x M3)), note that the result of (M1 x M2) is a 2 x 3 matrix and result of (M2 x M3) is a 1 x 4 matrix. 
((M1 x M2) x M3)  requires (2 x 1 x 3) + (2 x 3 x 4) = 30 
(M1 x (M2 x M3))  requires (1 x 3 x 4) + (2 x 1 x 4) = 20. 
The minimum of these two is 20.
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 3]
Output: 30
Explanation: There are 4 matrices of dimensions 1 × 2, 2 × 3, 3 × 4, 4 × 3. Let this 4 input matrices be M1, M2, M3 and M4. The minimum number of multiplications are obtained by ((M1 x M2) x M3) x M4). The minimum number is (1 x 2 x 3) + (1 x 3 x 4) + (1 x 4 x 3) = 30.
Input: arr[] = [3, 4]
Output: 0
Explanation: As there is only one matrix so, there is no cost of multiplication.
Constraints: 
2 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 100
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 200

class Solution {
    public:
      vector<vector<int>>dp;
      int answer(int start,int end,vector<int> &arr){
          if(end<=start) return 0;
          if(dp[start][end]!=INT_MAX) return dp[start][end];
          int ans=INT_MAX;
          for(int i=start;i<end;i++)  ans=min(ans, answer(start,i,arr) + answer(i+1,end,arr) + arr[start]*arr[i+1]*arr[end+1]);
          return dp[start][end]=ans;
      }
      int matrixMultiplication(vector<int> &arr) {
          // code here
         int n=arr.size();
         dp.assign(n,vector<int>(n,INT_MAX));
         return answer(0,n-2,arr);
      }
  };

3169. Count Days Without Meetings
Medium
Topics
Companies
Hint
You are given a positive integer days representing the total number of days an employee is available for work (starting from day 1). You are also given a 2D array meetings of size n where, meetings[i] = [start_i, end_i] represents the starting and ending days of meeting i (inclusive).

Return the count of days when the employee is available for work but no meetings are scheduled.

Note: The meetings may overlap.

 

Example 1:

Input: days = 10, meetings = [[5,7],[1,3],[9,10]]

Output: 2

Explanation:

There is no meeting scheduled on the 4th and 8th days.

Example 2:

Input: days = 5, meetings = [[2,4],[1,3]]

Output: 1

Explanation:

There is no meeting scheduled on the 5th day.

Example 3:

Input: days = 6, meetings = [[1,6]]

Output: 0

Explanation:

Meetings are scheduled for all working days.

 

Constraints:

1 <= days <= 109
1 <= meetings.length <= 105
meetings[i].length == 2
1 <= meetings[i][0] <= meetings[i][1] <= days
