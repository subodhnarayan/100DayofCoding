You are given the heights of consecutive buildings. You can move from the roof of a building to the roof of the next adjacent building. You need to find the maximum number of consecutive steps you can put forward such that you gain an increase in altitude with each step.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 2, 3, 2]
Output: 1
Explanation: 1, 2, or 2, 3 are the only consecutive buildings with increasing heights thus maximum number of consecutive steps with an increase in gain in altitude would be 1 in both cases.
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: 3
Explanation: 1 to 2 to 3 to 4 is the jump of length 3 to have a maximum number of buildings with increasing heights, so maximum steps with increasing altitude becomes 3.
Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= arr.size() <= 106
1 <= arr[i] <= 105


class Solution {
  public:
    // Function to find maximum number of consecutive steps
    // to gain an increase in altitude with each step.
    int maxStep(vector<int>& arr) {
      int n=arr.size();
      int count=0;
      int ans=0;
      for(int i=1;i<n;i++){
          if(arr[i]>arr[i-1]){
              count++;
          }
          else{
              ans=max(ans,count);
              count=0;
          }
      }
      ans=max(ans,count);
      return ans;
    }
};


729. My Calendar I
Solved

Hint
You are implementing a program to use as your calendar. We can add a new event if adding the event will not cause a double booking.

A double booking happens when two events have some non-empty intersection (i.e., some moment is common to both events.).

The event can be represented as a pair of integers start and end that represents a booking on the half-open interval [start, end), the range of real numbers x such that start <= x < end.

Implement the MyCalendar class:

MyCalendar() Initializes the calendar object.
boolean book(int start, int end) Returns true if the event can be added to the calendar successfully without causing a double booking. Otherwise, return false and do not add the event to the calendar.
 

Example 1:

Input
["MyCalendar", "book", "book", "book"]
[[], [10, 20], [15, 25], [20, 30]]
Output
[null, true, false, true]

Explanation
MyCalendar myCalendar = new MyCalendar();
myCalendar.book(10, 20); // return True
myCalendar.book(15, 25); // return False, It can not be booked because time 15 is already booked by another event.
myCalendar.book(20, 30); // return True, The event can be booked, as the first event takes every time less than 20, but not including 20.
 

Constraints:

0 <= start < end <= 109
At most 1000 calls will be made to book.


class MyCalendar {
    map<int, int> intervals;
public:
    MyCalendar() {
        
    }
    
    bool book(int start, int end) {
        auto next = intervals.lower_bound(start); // Find next interval
        if (next != intervals.end() && next->first < end) {
            return false; // Overlaps with next interval
        }
        if (next != intervals.begin() && prev(next)->second > start) {
            return false; // Overlaps with previous interval
        }
        intervals[start] = end; // No overlap, add interval
        return true;
    }
};
