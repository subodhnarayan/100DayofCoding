K-Pangrams
Difficulty: EasyAccuracy: 20.91%Submissions: 55K+Points: 2
Given a string str and an integer k, return true if the string can be changed into a pangram after at most k operations, else return false.

A single operation consists of swapping an existing alphabetic character with any other lowercase alphabetic character.

Note - A pangram is a sentence containing every letter in the english alphabet.

Examples :

Input: str = "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog", k = 0
Output: true
Explanation: the sentence contains all 26 characters and is already a pangram.
Input: str = "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa", k = 25 
Output: true
Explanation: The word contains 26 instances of 'a'. Since only 25 operations are allowed. We can keep 1 instance and change all others to make str a pangram.
Input: str = "a b c d e f g h i j k l m", k = 20
Output: false
Explanation: Since there are only 13 alphabetic characters in this case, no amount of swapping can produce a panagram here.
Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)  

Constraints:
1<= str.size() <= 105
0<= k <= 50
str may contain duplicate characters
str contains only lowercase alphabets or spaces.

class Solution {
  public:

    bool kPangram(string str, int k) {
        // code here
          string s = "";
        for(auto i :str)
        {
            if(i== ' ')continue;
            else s+=i;
        }
        
        if(s.length()<26)return 0;
        set<char>st;
        for(int i=0;i<s.length();i++)
        {
            st.insert(s[i]);
        }
        if(st.size()+k >=26 || st.size()>=26)return 1;
        return 0;

Hint
There are n cities numbered from 0 to n-1. Given the array edges where edges[i] = [fromi, toi, weighti] represents a bidirectional and weighted edge between cities fromi and toi, and given the integer distanceThreshold.

Return the city with the smallest number of cities that are reachable through some path and whose distance is at most distanceThreshold, If there are multiple such cities, return the city with the greatest number.

Notice that the distance of a path connecting cities i and j is equal to the sum of the edges' weights along that path.

 

Example 1:


Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1,3],[1,2,1],[1,3,4],[2,3,1]], distanceThreshold = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: The figure above describes the graph. 
The neighboring cities at a distanceThreshold = 4 for each city are:
City 0 -> [City 1, City 2] 
City 1 -> [City 0, City 2, City 3] 
City 2 -> [City 0, City 1, City 3] 
City 3 -> [City 1, City 2] 
Cities 0 and 3 have 2 neighboring cities at a distanceThreshold = 4, but we have to return city 3 since it has the greatest number.
Example 2:


Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1,2],[0,4,8],[1,2,3],[1,4,2],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]], distanceThreshold = 2
Output: 0
Explanation: The figure above describes the graph. 
The neighboring cities at a distanceThreshold = 2 for each city are:
City 0 -> [City 1] 
City 1 -> [City 0, City 4] 
City 2 -> [City 3, City 4] 
City 3 -> [City 2, City 4]
City 4 -> [City 1, City 2, City 3] 
The city 0 has 1 neighboring city at a distanceThreshold = 2.
 

Constraints:

2 <= n <= 100
1 <= edges.length <= n * (n - 1) / 2
edges[i].length == 3
0 <= fromi < toi < n
1 <= weighti, distanceThreshold <= 10^4
All pairs (fromi, toi) are distinct.
