Count Inversions
Difficulty: MediumAccuracy: 16.93%Submissions: 597K+Points: 4
Given an array of integers arr[]. Find the Inversion Count in the array.
Two elements arr[i] and arr[j] form an inversion if arr[i] > arr[j] and i < j.

Inversion Count: For an array, inversion count indicates how far (or close) the array is from being sorted. If the array is already sorted then the inversion count is 0.
If an array is sorted in the reverse order then the inversion count is the maximum. 

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [2, 4, 1, 3, 5]
Output: 3
Explanation: The sequence 2, 4, 1, 3, 5 has three inversions (2, 1), (4, 1), (4, 3).
Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
Output: 0
Explanation: As the sequence is already sorted so there is no inversion count.
Input: arr[] = [10, 10, 10]
Output: 0
Explanation: As all the elements of array are same, so there is no inversion count.
Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 104


class Solution {
  public:
    // Function to count inversions in the array.
    int mergeAndCount(vector<int>& arr, int left, int mid, int right) {
    int count = 0;

    // Sizes of two subarrays
    int n1 = mid - left + 1;
    int n2 = right - mid;

    // Temporary arrays
    vector<int> leftArr(n1), rightArr(n2);
    for (int i = 0; i < n1; i++) leftArr[i] = arr[left + i];
    for (int i = 0; i < n2; i++) rightArr[i] = arr[mid + 1 + i];

    // Merge the two arrays and count inversions
    int i = 0, j = 0, k = left;
    while (i < n1 && j < n2) {
        if (leftArr[i] <= rightArr[j]) {
            arr[k++] = leftArr[i++];
        } else {
            arr[k++] = rightArr[j++];
            count += (n1 - i); // All remaining elements in leftArr are inversions
        }
    }

    // Copy remaining elements
    while (i < n1) arr[k++] = leftArr[i++];
    while (j < n2) arr[k++] = rightArr[j++];

    return count;
}

int mergeSortAndCount(vector<int>& arr, int left, int right) {
    if (left >= right) return 0;

    int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
    int count = 0;

    count += mergeSortAndCount(arr, left, mid);
    count += mergeSortAndCount(arr, mid + 1, right);
    count += mergeAndCount(arr, left, mid, right);

    return count;
}
    int inversionCount(vector<int> &arr) {
           return mergeSortAndCount(arr, 0, arr.size() - 1);
    }
};

1760. Minimum Limit of Balls in a Bag

You are given an integer array nums where the ith bag contains nums[i] balls. You are also given an integer maxOperations.

You can perform the following operation at most maxOperations times:

Take any bag of balls and divide it into two new bags with a positive number of balls.
For example, a bag of 5 balls can become two new bags of 1 and 4 balls, or two new bags of 2 and 3 balls.
Your penalty is the maximum number of balls in a bag. You want to minimize your penalty after the operations.

Return the minimum possible penalty after performing the operations.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [9], maxOperations = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: 
- Divide the bag with 9 balls into two bags of sizes 6 and 3. [9] -> [6,3].
- Divide the bag with 6 balls into two bags of sizes 3 and 3. [6,3] -> [3,3,3].
The bag with the most number of balls has 3 balls, so your penalty is 3 and you should return 3.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,4,8,2], maxOperations = 4
Output: 2
Explanation:
- Divide the bag with 8 balls into two bags of sizes 4 and 4. [2,4,8,2] -> [2,4,4,4,2].
- Divide the bag with 4 balls into two bags of sizes 2 and 2. [2,4,4,4,2] -> [2,2,2,4,4,2].
- Divide the bag with 4 balls into two bags of sizes 2 and 2. [2,2,2,4,4,2] -> [2,2,2,2,2,4,2].
- Divide the bag with 4 balls into two bags of sizes 2 and 2. [2,2,2,2,2,4,2] -> [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2].
The bag with the most number of balls has 2 balls, so your penalty is 2, and you should return 2.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
1 <= maxOperations, nums[i] <= 109
