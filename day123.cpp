Minimum number of deletions and insertions
Difficulty: MediumAccuracy: 65.29%Submissions: 63K+Points: 4
Given two strings str1 and str2. The task is to remove or insert the minimum number of characters from/in str1 so as to transform it into str2. It could be possible that the same character needs to be removed/deleted from one point of str1 and inserted to some another point.

Examples :

Input: str1 = "heap", str2 = "pea"
Output: 3
Explanation: 2 deletions and 1 insertion.
p and h deleted from heap. Then, p is inserted at the beginning.
One thing to note, though p was required yet it was removed/deleted first from its position and then it is inserted to some other position. Thus, p contributes one to the deletion_count and one to the insertion_count.
Input : str1 = "geeksforgeeks", str2 = "geeks"
Output: 8
Explanation: 8 deletions, i.e. remove all characters of the string "forgeeks".
Expected Time Complexity: O(|str1|*|str2|)
Expected Space Complexity: O(|str1|*|str2|)

Constraints:
1 ≤ |str1|, |str2| ≤ 1000
All the characters are lowercase English alphabets


class Solution{
		

	public:
	int minOperations(string str1, string str2) 
	{ 
	    int m = str1.length(), n = str2.length();
    vector<vector<int>> c(m + 1, vector<int>(n + 1, 0));

    for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
            if (str1[i - 1] == str2[j - 1])
                c[i][j] = c[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;
            else
                c[i][j] = max(c[i - 1][j], c[i][j - 1]);
        }
    }
    
    int lcsL = c[m][n];
    return (n - lcsL) + (m - lcsL);
	} 
};

1945. Sum of Digits of String After Convert
Solved

Hint
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters, and an integer k.

First, convert s into an integer by replacing each letter with its position in the alphabet (i.e., replace 'a' with 1, 'b' with 2, ..., 'z' with 26). Then, transform the integer by replacing it with the sum of its digits. Repeat the transform operation k times in total.

For example, if s = "zbax" and k = 2, then the resulting integer would be 8 by the following operations:

Convert: "zbax" ➝ "(26)(2)(1)(24)" ➝ "262124" ➝ 262124
Transform #1: 262124 ➝ 2 + 6 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 4 ➝ 17
Transform #2: 17 ➝ 1 + 7 ➝ 8
Return the resulting integer after performing the operations described above.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "iiii", k = 1
Output: 36
Explanation: The operations are as follows:
- Convert: "iiii" ➝ "(9)(9)(9)(9)" ➝ "9999" ➝ 9999
- Transform #1: 9999 ➝ 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 ➝ 36
Thus the resulting integer is 36.
Example 2:

Input: s = "leetcode", k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: The operations are as follows:
- Convert: "leetcode" ➝ "(12)(5)(5)(20)(3)(15)(4)(5)" ➝ "12552031545" ➝ 12552031545
- Transform #1: 12552031545 ➝ 1 + 2 + 5 + 5 + 2 + 0 + 3 + 1 + 5 + 4 + 5 ➝ 33
- Transform #2: 33 ➝ 3 + 3 ➝ 6
Thus the resulting integer is 6.
Example 3:

Input: s = "zbax", k = 2
Output: 8
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 100
1 <= k <= 10
s consists of lowercase English letters.
