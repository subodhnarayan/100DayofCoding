Given an array arr[] containing 2*n + 2 positive numbers, out of which 2*n numbers exist in pairs whereas only two number occur exactly once and are distinct. Find the other two numbers. Return the answer in increasing order.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4]
Output: [3, 4] 
Explanation: 3 and 4 occur exactly once.
Input: arr[] = [2, 1, 3, 2]
Output: [1, 3]
Explanation: 1 and 3 occur exactly once.
Input: arr[] = [2, 1, 3, 3]
Output: [1, 2]
Explanation: 1 and 2 occur exactly once.
Constraints:
2 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 106 
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 5 * 106
arr.size() is even

Expected Complexities
Time Complexity: O(n)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)
