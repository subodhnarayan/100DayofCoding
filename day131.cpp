Minimum Cost of ropes
Difficulty: EasyAccuracy: 42.73%Submissions: 218K+Points: 2
Given an array arr containing the lengths of the different ropes, we need to connect these ropes to form one rope. The cost to connect two ropes is equal to sum of their lengths. The task is to connect the ropes with minimum cost.  

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [4, 3, 2, 6]
Output: 29
Explanation: We can connect the ropes in following ways.
1) First connect ropes of lengths 2 and 3. Which makes the array [4, 5, 6]. Cost of this operation 2 + 3 = 5. 
2) Now connect ropes of lengths 4 and 5. Which makes the array [9, 6]. Cost of this operation 4 + 5 = 9.
3) Finally connect the two ropes and all ropes have connected. Cost of this operation 9 + 6 =15
Total cost for connecting all ropes is 5 + 9 + 15 = 29. This is the optimized cost for connecting ropes. 
Other ways of connecting ropes would always have same or more cost. For example, if we connect 4 and 6 first (we get three rope of 3, 2 and 10), then connect 10 and 3 (we gettwo rope of 13 and 2). Finally we connect 13 and 2. Total cost in this way is 10 + 13 + 15 = 38.
Input: arr[] = [4, 2, 7, 6, 9]
Output: 62 
Explanation: First, connect ropes 4 and 2, which makes the array [6, 7, 6, 9]. Cost of this operation 4 + 2 = 6. 
Next, add ropes 6 and 6, which results in [12, 7, 9]. Cost of this operation 6 + 6 = 12.
Then, add 7 and 9, which makes the array [12,16]. Cost of this operation 7 + 9 = 16. And
finally, add these two which gives [28]. Hence, the total cost is 6 + 12 + 16 + 28 = 62.
Expected Time Complexity: O(n logn)
Expected Auxilliary Space: O(n)

Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 205
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 106


class Solution {
  public:
    // Function to return the minimum cost of connecting the ropes.
    long long minCost(vector<long long>& arr) {
        // Your code here
        long long ans=0;
        priority_queue<long long, vector<long long>, greater<long long>> pq;
        
        for(auto x:arr){
            pq.push(x);
        }
        
        while(pq.size()!=1){
            long long first=pq.top();
            pq.pop();
            long long second=pq.top();
             pq.pop();
            long long total=first+second;
            pq.push(total);
            ans+=total;
        }
        
        return ans;
            
        }
        
        
};

2220. Minimum Bit Flips to Convert Number
Solved
Easy
Topics
Companies
Hint
A bit flip of a number x is choosing a bit in the binary representation of x and flipping it from either 0 to 1 or 1 to 0.

For example, for x = 7, the binary representation is 111 and we may choose any bit (including any leading zeros not shown) and flip it. We can flip the first bit from the right to get 110, flip the second bit from the right to get 101, flip the fifth bit from the right (a leading zero) to get 10111, etc.
Given two integers start and goal, return the minimum number of bit flips to convert start to goal.

 

Example 1:

Input: start = 10, goal = 7
Output: 3
Explanation: The binary representation of 10 and 7 are 1010 and 0111 respectively. We can convert 10 to 7 in 3 steps:
- Flip the first bit from the right: 1010 -> 1011.
- Flip the third bit from the right: 1011 -> 1111.
- Flip the fourth bit from the right: 1111 -> 0111.
It can be shown we cannot convert 10 to 7 in less than 3 steps. Hence, we return 3.
Example 2:

Input: start = 3, goal = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: The binary representation of 3 and 4 are 011 and 100 respectively. We can convert 3 to 4 in 3 steps:
- Flip the first bit from the right: 011 -> 010.
- Flip the second bit from the right: 010 -> 000.
- Flip the third bit from the right: 000 -> 100.
It can be shown we cannot convert 3 to 4 in less than 3 steps. Hence, we return 3.
 

Constraints:

0 <= start, goal <= 109

public:
    int minBitFlips(int start, int goal) {
        int xorResult = start ^ goal;
        int ans = 0;
        
        
        while (xorResult > 0) {
            ans += xorResult & 1; 
            xorResult >>= 1;
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
