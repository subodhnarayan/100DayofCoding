Max Circular Subarray Sum
Difficulty: HardAccuracy: 29.37%Submissions: 125K+Points: 8
Given an array of integers arr[] in a circular fashion. Find the maximum subarray sum that we can get if we assume the array to be circular.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [8, -8, 9, -9, 10, -11, 12]
Output: 22
Explanation: Starting from the last element of the array, i.e, 12, and moving in a circular fashion, we have max subarray as 12, 8, -8, 9, -9, 10, which gives maximum sum as 22.
Input: arr[] = [10, -3, -4, 7, 6, 5, -4, -1]
Output: 23
Explanation: Maximum sum of the circular subarray is 23. The subarray is [7, 6, 5, -4, -1, 10].
Input: arr[] = [-1, 40, -14, 7, 6, 5, -4, -1] 
Output: 52
Explanation: Circular Subarray [7, 6, 5, -4, -1, -1, 40] has the maximum sum, which is 52.
Constraints:
1 <= arr.size() <= 105
-104 <= arr[i] <= 104


class Solution {
  public:
    // arr: input array
    // Function to find maximum circular subarray sum.
    int circularSubarraySum(vector<int> &arr) {

        // your code here
        int n=arr.size();
        int maxi1=0,sum1=0,total=0;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            sum1+=arr[i];
            total+=arr[i];
            if(sum1>maxi1) maxi1=max(sum1,maxi1);
            if(sum1<0) sum1=0;
        }
        
        int maxi2=0,sum2=0;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            sum2+=arr[i];
            maxi2=min(maxi2,sum2);
            if(sum2>0) sum2=0;
        }
        
        return max(maxi1,total-maxi2);
    }
};

int main() {
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    cin.ignore();
    while (t--) {
        vector<int> arr;

        stringstream ss(input);
        int number;
        while (ss >> number) {
            arr.push_back(number);
        }

        Solution ob;
        int res = ob.circularSubarraySum(arr);

        cout << res << endl;
    }
    return 0;

// } Driver Code Ends

2924. Find Champion II
Solved

Topics
Companies
Hint
There are n teams numbered from 0 to n - 1 in a tournament; each team is also a node in a DAG.

You are given the integer n and a 0-indexed 2D integer array edges of length m representing the DAG, where edges[i] = [ui, vi] indicates that there is a directed edge from team ui to team vi in the graph.

A directed edge from a to b in the graph means that team a is stronger than team b and team b is weaker than team a.

Team a will be the champion of the tournament if there is no team b that is stronger than team a.

Return the team that will be the champion of the tournament if there is a unique champion, otherwise, return -1.

Notes

A cycle is a series of nodes a1, a2, ..., an, an+1 such that node a1 is the same node as node an+1, the nodes a1, a2, ..., an are distinct, and there is a directed edge from the node ai to node ai+1 for every i in the range [1, n].
A DAG is a directed graph that does not have any cycle.
 

Example 1:



Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2]]
Output: 0
Explanation: Team 1 is weaker than team 0. Team 2 is weaker than team 1. So the champion is team 0.
Example 2:



Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,2],[1,3],[1,2]]
Output: -1
Explanation: Team 2 is weaker than team 0 and team 1. Team 3 is weaker than team 1. But team 1 and team 0 are not weaker than any other teams. So the answer is -1.
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 100
m == edges.length
0 <= m <= n * (n - 1) / 2
edges[i].length == 2
0 <= edge[i][j] <= n - 1
edges[i][0] != edges[i][1]
The input is generated such that if team a is stronger than team b, team b is not stronger than team a.
The input is generated such that if team a is stronger than team b and team b is stronger than team c, then team a is stronger than team c.


class Solution {
public:
    int findChampion(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        bitset<100> losses; 
        
        for (const auto& edge : edges) {
            losses.set(edge[1]);
        }
        
        int champion = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (!losses[i]) {
                if (champion != -1) return -1;
                champion = i;
            }
        }
        
        return champion;
    }
};
