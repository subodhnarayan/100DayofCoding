Peak element
Difficulty: BasicAccuracy: 38.86%Submissions: 507K+Points: 1
Given an array arr[] where no two adjacent elements are same, find the index of a peak element. An element is considered to be a peak if it is greater than its adjacent elements (if they exist). If there are multiple peak elements, return index of any one of them. The output will be "true" if the index returned by your function is correct; otherwise, it will be "false".

Note: Consider the element before the first element and the element after the last element to be negative infinity.

Examples :

Input: arr = [1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 3]
Output: true
Explanation: arr[5] = 8 is a peak element because arr[4] < arr[5] > arr[6].
Input: arr = [10, 20, 15, 2, 23, 90, 80]
Output: true
Explanation: arr[1] = 20 and arr[5] = 90 are peak elements because arr[0] < arr[1] > arr[2] and arr[4] < arr[5] > arr[6]. 
Input: arr = [1, 2, 3]
Output: true
Explanation: arr[2] is a peak element because arr[1] < arr[2] and arr[2] is the last element, so it has negative infinity to its right.
Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 106
-231 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 231 - 1

1792. Maximum Average Pass Ratio
Solved
Medium
Topics
Companies
Hint
There is a school that has classes of students and each class will be having a final exam. You are given a 2D integer array classes, where classes[i] = [passi, totali]. You know beforehand that in the ith class, there are totali total students, but only passi number of students will pass the exam.

You are also given an integer extraStudents. There are another extraStudents brilliant students that are guaranteed to pass the exam of any class they are assigned to. You want to assign each of the extraStudents students to a class in a way that maximizes the average pass ratio across all the classes.

The pass ratio of a class is equal to the number of students of the class that will pass the exam divided by the total number of students of the class. The average pass ratio is the sum of pass ratios of all the classes divided by the number of the classes.

Return the maximum possible average pass ratio after assigning the extraStudents students. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.

 

Example 1:

Input: classes = [[1,2],[3,5],[2,2]], extraStudents = 2
Output: 0.78333
Explanation: You can assign the two extra students to the first class. The average pass ratio will be equal to (3/4 + 3/5 + 2/2) / 3 = 0.78333.
Example 2:

Input: classes = [[2,4],[3,9],[4,5],[2,10]], extraStudents = 4
Output: 0.53485
 

Constraints:

1 <= classes.length <= 105
classes[i].length == 2
1 <= passi <= totali <= 105
1 <= extraStudents <= 105


class Solution {
public:
    double maxAverageRatio(vector<vector<int>>& classes, int extraStudents) {
        // Lambda to calculate the gain of adding an extra student
        auto calculateGain = [](int passes, int totalStudents) {
            return (double)(passes + 1) / (totalStudents + 1) -
                   (double)passes / totalStudents;
        };

        // Max heap to store (-gain, passes, totalStudents)
        priority_queue<pair<double, pair<int, int>>> maxHeap;
        for (const auto& singleClass : classes) {
            maxHeap.push({calculateGain(singleClass[0], singleClass[1]),
                          {singleClass[0], singleClass[1]}});
        }

        // Distribute extra students
        while (extraStudents--) {
            auto [currentGain, classInfo] = maxHeap.top();
            maxHeap.pop();
            int passes = classInfo.first;
            int totalStudents = classInfo.second;
            maxHeap.push({calculateGain(passes + 1, totalStudents + 1),
                          {passes + 1, totalStudents + 1}});
        }

        // Calculate the final average pass ratio
        double totalPassRatio = 0;
        while (!maxHeap.empty()) {
            auto [_, classInfo] = maxHeap.top();
            maxHeap.pop();
            totalPassRatio += (double)classInfo.first / classInfo.second;
        }

        return totalPassRatio / classes.size();
    }
