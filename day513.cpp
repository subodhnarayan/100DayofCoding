Sum of all substrings of a number
Difficulty: MediumAccuracy: 38.11%Submissions: 66K+Points: 4
Given an integer s represented as a string, the task is to get the sum of all possible sub-strings of this string.

Note: The number may have leading zeros.
It is guaranteed that the total sum will fit within a 32-bit signed integer.

Examples:

Input: s = "6759"
Output: 8421
Explanation:
Sum = 6 + 7 + 5 + 9 + 67 + 75 + 59 + 675 + 759 + 6759 = 8421
Input: s = "421"
Output: 491
Explanation: 
Sum = 4 + 2 + 1 + 42 + 21 + 421 = 491
Constraints:
1 <= |s| <= 9

Expected Complexities
Time Complexity: O(n)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)

2942. Find Words Containing Character
Solved
Easy
Topics
Companies
Hint
You are given a 0-indexed array of strings words and a character x.

Return an array of indices representing the words that contain the character x.

Note that the returned array may be in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: words = ["leet","code"], x = "e"
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: "e" occurs in both words: "leet", and "code". Hence, we return indices 0 and 1.
Example 2:

Input: words = ["abc","bcd","aaaa","cbc"], x = "a"
Output: [0,2]
Explanation: "a" occurs in "abc", and "aaaa". Hence, we return indices 0 and 2.
Example 3:

Input: words = ["abc","bcd","aaaa","cbc"], x = "z"
Output: []
Explanation: "z" does not occur in any of the words. Hence, we return an empty array.
 

Constraints:

1 <= words.length <= 50
1 <= words[i].length <= 50
x is a lowercase English letter.
words[i] consists only of lowercase English letters

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findWordsContaining(vector<string>& words, char x) {
        vector<int> res;
        int n = words.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (words[i].find(x) != string::npos) {
                res.push_back(i);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
