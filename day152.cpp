Rotate and delete
Difficulty: MediumAccuracy: 20.63%Submissions: 55K+Points: 4
Given an array arr integers. Assume sz to be the initial size of the array. Do the following operations exactly sz/2 times. In every kth (1<= k <= sz/2) operation:

Right-rotate the array clockwise by 1.
Delete the (nâ€“ k + 1)th element from begin.
Now, Return the first element of the array.
Note: Here n keeps on decreasing with every operation.

Examples:

Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
Output: 3
Explanation: Rotate the array clockwise i.e. after rotation the array arr = [6, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and delete the last element that is 5 that will be arr = [6, 1, 2, 3, 4]. Again rotate the array for the second time and deletes the second last element that is 2 that will be A = [4, 6, 1, 3], doing similar operation when we perform 4th operation, 4th last element does not exist. Then we deletes 1st element ie 1 that will be arr = [3, 6]. So, continuing this procedure the last element in arr is 2. So, the output will be 3.
Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: 2
Explanation: Rotate the vector clockwise i.e. after rotation the vector arr = [4, 1, 2, 3] and delete the last element that is 3 that will be arr = [4, 1, 2]. After doing all the operations, the output will be 2.
Expected Time Complexity: O(n2)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= arr.size() <= 103
1 <= arr[i] <= 106



class Solution {
  public:
    int rotateDelete(vector<int> &arr) {
        // Your code here
        int n=arr.size();
        int temp=n/2;
        int i=3*(temp/2);
        if(temp%2)
        i++;
        return arr[n-i];
    }

Hint
Given an array of integers arr, replace each element with its rank.

The rank represents how large the element is. The rank has the following rules:

Rank is an integer starting from 1.
The larger the element, the larger the rank. If two elements are equal, their rank must be the same.
Rank should be as small as possible.
 

Example 1:

Input: arr = [40,10,20,30]
Output: [4,1,2,3]
Explanation: 40 is the largest element. 10 is the smallest. 20 is the second smallest. 30 is the third smallest.
Example 2:

Input: arr = [100,100,100]
Output: [1,1,1]
Explanation: Same elements share the same rank.
Example 3:

Input: arr = [37,12,28,9,100,56,80,5,12]
Output: [5,3,4,2,8,6,7,1,3]
 

Constraints:

0 <= arr.length <= 105
-109 <= arr[i] <= 109
