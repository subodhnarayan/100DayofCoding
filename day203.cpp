Stock Buy and Sell â€“ Max one Transaction Allowed
Difficulty: EasyAccuracy: 49.33%Submissions: 31K+Points: 2
Given an array prices[] of length n, representing the prices of the stocks on different days. The task is to find the maximum profit possible by buying and selling the stocks on different days when at most one transaction is allowed. Here one transaction means 1 buy + 1 Sell. If it is not possible to make a profit then return 0.

Note: Stock must be bought before being sold.

Examples:

Input: prices[] = [7, 10, 1, 3, 6, 9, 2]
Output: 8
Explanation: You can buy the stock on day 2 at price = 1 and sell it on day 5 at price = 9. Hence, the profit is 8.
Input: prices[] = [7, 6, 4, 3, 1]
Output: 0 
Explanation: Here the prices are in decreasing order, hence if we buy any day then we cannot sell it at a greater price. Hence, the answer is 0.
Input: prices[] = [1, 3, 6, 9, 11]
Output: 10 
Explanation: Since the array is sorted in increasing order, we can make maximum profit by buying at price[0] and selling at price[n-1].
Constraint:
1 <= prices.size()<= 105
0 <= prices[i] <=104

class Solution {
  public:
    int maximumProfit(vector<int> &prices) {
        int n=prices.size();
        int profit=0;
        int buy=prices[0];
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            buy=min(buy,prices[i]);
            
            int cprof=prices[i]-buy;
            profit=max(cprof,profit);
        }
        return profit;
    }
};

1072. Flip Columns For Maximum Number of Equal Rows
Solved
Medium
Topics
Companies
Hint
You are given an m x n binary matrix matrix.

You can choose any number of columns in the matrix and flip every cell in that column (i.e., Change the value of the cell from 0 to 1 or vice versa).

Return the maximum number of rows that have all values equal after some number of flips.

 

Example 1:

Input: matrix = [[0,1],[1,1]]
Output: 1
Explanation: After flipping no values, 1 row has all values equal.
Example 2:

Input: matrix = [[0,1],[1,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: After flipping values in the first column, both rows have equal values.
Example 3:

Input: matrix = [[0,0,0],[0,0,1],[1,1,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: After flipping values in the first two columns, the last two rows have equal values.
 

Constraints:

m == matrix.length
n == matrix[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 300
matrix[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
