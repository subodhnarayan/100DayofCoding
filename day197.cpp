Move All Zeroes to End
Difficulty: EasyAccuracy: 45.51%Submissions: 211K+Points: 2
Given an array arr[]. Push all the zeros of the given array to the right end of the array while maintaining the order of non-zero elements. Do the mentioned change in the array in place.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 0, 4, 3, 0, 5, 0]
Output: [1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0]
Explanation: There are three 0s that are moved to the end.
Input: arr[] = [10, 20, 30]
Output: [10, 20, 30]
Explanation: No change in array as there are no 0s.
Input: arr[] = [0, 0]
Output: [0, 0]
Explanation: No change in array as there are all 0s.
Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10

class Solution {
  public:
    void pushZerosToEnd(vector<int>& arr) {
        vector<int> ans;
        int n=arr.size();
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            if(arr[i]!=0){
                ans.push_back(arr[i]);
            }
        }
        for(int i=0;i<ans.size();i++){
            arr[i]=ans[i];
        }
        for(int i=ans.size();i<arr.size();i++){
            arr[i]=0;
        }
    }

3254. Find the Power of K-Size Subarrays I

Topics
Companies
Hint
You are given an array of integers nums of length n and a positive integer k.

The power of an array is defined as:

Its maximum element if all of its elements are consecutive and sorted in ascending order.
-1 otherwise.
You need to find the power of all 
subarrays
 of nums of size k.

Return an integer array results of size n - k + 1, where results[i] is the power of nums[i..(i + k - 1)].

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,3,2,5], k = 3

Output: [3,4,-1,-1,-1]

Explanation:

There are 5 subarrays of nums of size 3:

[1, 2, 3] with the maximum element 3.
[2, 3, 4] with the maximum element 4.
[3, 4, 3] whose elements are not consecutive.
[4, 3, 2] whose elements are not sorted.
[3, 2, 5] whose elements are not consecutive.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,2,2,2,2], k = 4

Output: [-1,-1]

Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,2,3,2,3,2], k = 2

Output: [-1,3,-1,3,-1]

 

Constraints:

1 <= n == nums.length <= 500
1 <= nums[i] <= 105
1 <= k <= n
