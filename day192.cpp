Make array elements unique
Difficulty: MediumAccuracy: 51.43%Submissions: 54K+Points: 4
Given an array arr[ ], your task is to find the minimum number of increment operations required to make all the elements of the array unique. i.e.- no value in the array should occur more than once. In one operation, a value can be incremented by 1 only.

Examples :

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 2]
Output: 1
Explanation: If we increase arr[2] by 1 then the resulting array becomes {1, 2, 3} and has all unique values.Hence, the answer is 1 in this case.
Input: arr[] = [1, 1, 2, 3]
Output: 3
Explanation: If we increase arr[0] by 3, then all array elements will be unique. Hence, the answer is 3 in this case.
Input: arr[] = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
Output: 0
Explanation: All elements are unique.
Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 106
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 106


class Solution {
  public:
    int minIncrements(vector<int>& arr) {
        // Code here
         sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());

        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < arr.size(); i++) {
            if (arr[i] <= arr[i - 1]) {
                int increment = arr[i - 1] - arr[i] + 1;
                arr[i] = arr[i - 1] + 1;
                ans += increment;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};

Hint
You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of length n.

You can perform the following operation as many times as you want:

Pick an index i that you haven’t picked before, and pick a prime p strictly less than nums[i], then subtract p from nums[i].
Return true if you can make nums a strictly increasing array using the above operation and false otherwise.

A strictly increasing array is an array whose each element is strictly greater than its preceding element.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,9,6,10]
Output: true
Explanation: In the first operation: Pick i = 0 and p = 3, and then subtract 3 from nums[0], so that nums becomes [1,9,6,10].
In the second operation: i = 1, p = 7, subtract 7 from nums[1], so nums becomes equal to [1,2,6,10].
After the second operation, nums is sorted in strictly increasing order, so the answer is true.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [6,8,11,12]
Output: true
Explanation: Initially nums is sorted in strictly increasing order, so we don't need to make any operations.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [5,8,3]
Output: false
Explanation: It can be proven that there is no way to perform operations to make nums sorted in strictly increasing order, so the answer is false.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 1000
1 <= nums[i] <= 1000
nums.length == n
