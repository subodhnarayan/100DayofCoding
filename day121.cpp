Max sum path in two arrays
Difficulty: MediumAccuracy: 30.9%Submissions: 68K+Points: 4
Given two sorted arrays of distinct integers arr1 and arr2. Each array may have some elements in common with the other array. Find the maximum sum of a path from the beginning of any array to the end of any array. You can switch from one array to another array only at the common elements.

Note:  When we switch from one array to other,  we need to consider the common element only once in the result.

Examples : 

Input: arr1 = [2, 3, 7, 10, 12] , arr2 = [1, 5, 7, 8]
Output: 35
Explanation: The path will be 1+5+7+10+12 = 35, where 1 and 5 come from arr2 and then 7 is common so we switch to arr1 and add 10 and 12.
Input: arr1 = [1, 2, 3] , arr2[] = [3, 4, 5]
Output: 15
Explanation: The path will be 1+2+3+4+5=15.
Expected Time Complexity: O(m + n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
Constraints:
1 <= arr1.size(), arr2.size() <= 104
1 <= arr1[i], arr2[i] <= 105




class Solution {
  public:
    int maxPathSum(vector<int> &arr1, vector<int> &arr2) {
         int i=0, j=0,sum1=0,sum2=0,ans =0;
        while(i<arr1.size() && j<arr2.size()){
            if(arr1[i]<arr2[j])sum1+=arr1[i++];
            else if(arr2[j]<arr1[i])sum2+=arr2[j++];
            else if(arr1[i]==arr2[j]){
                ans+=max(sum1,sum2)+arr1[i];
                i++;
                j++;
                sum1=0;
                sum2=0;
            }
        }
        while(i<arr1.size())sum1+=arr1[i++];
        while(j<arr2.size())sum2+=arr2[j++];
        ans+=max(sum1,sum2);
        return ans;
    }

Hint
You are given a 0-indexed 1-dimensional (1D) integer array original, and two integers, m and n. You are tasked with creating a 2-dimensional (2D) array with  m rows and n columns using all the elements from original.

The elements from indices 0 to n - 1 (inclusive) of original should form the first row of the constructed 2D array, the elements from indices n to 2 * n - 1 (inclusive) should form the second row of the constructed 2D array, and so on.

Return an m x n 2D array constructed according to the above procedure, or an empty 2D array if it is impossible.

 

Example 1:


Input: original = [1,2,3,4], m = 2, n = 2
Output: [[1,2],[3,4]]
Explanation: The constructed 2D array should contain 2 rows and 2 columns.
The first group of n=2 elements in original, [1,2], becomes the first row in the constructed 2D array.
The second group of n=2 elements in original, [3,4], becomes the second row in the constructed 2D array.
Example 2:

Input: original = [1,2,3], m = 1, n = 3
Output: [[1,2,3]]
Explanation: The constructed 2D array should contain 1 row and 3 columns.
Put all three elements in original into the first row of the constructed 2D array.
Example 3:

Input: original = [1,2], m = 1, n = 1
Output: []
Explanation: There are 2 elements in original.
It is impossible to fit 2 elements in a 1x1 2D array, so return an empty 2D array.
 

Constraints:

1 <= original.length <= 5 * 104
1 <= original[i] <= 105
1 <= m, n <= 4 * 104


class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> construct2DArray(vector<int>& original, int m, int n) {
        vector<vector<int>> result(m);
        int i;
        switch (m * n == original.size() ? 1 : 0) {
            case 1:
                i = 0;
                while (i < m) {
                    result[i] = vector<int>(original.begin() + i * n, original.begin() + (i * n + n));
                    i++;
                }
                break;
            default:
                return {};
        }
        return result;
    }
};
