Missing And Repeating
Difficulty: MediumAccuracy: 24.83%Submissions: 503K+Points: 4
Given an unsorted array arr of of positive integers. One number 'A' from set {1, 2,....,n} is missing and one number 'B' occurs twice in array. Find numbers A and B.

Examples

Input: arr[] = [2, 2]
Output: 2 1
Explanation: Repeating number is 2 and smallest positive missing number is 1.
Input: arr[] = [1, 3, 3] 
Output: 3 2
Explanation: Repeating number is 3 and smallest positive missing number is 2.
Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
2 ≤ n ≤ 105
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ n

2707. Extra Characters in a String
Solved
Medium
Topics
Companies
Hint
You are given a 0-indexed string s and a dictionary of words dictionary. You have to break s into one or more non-overlapping substrings such that each substring is present in dictionary. There may be some extra characters in s which are not present in any of the substrings.

Return the minimum number of extra characters left over if you break up s optimally.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "leetscode", dictionary = ["leet","code","leetcode"]
Output: 1
Explanation: We can break s in two substrings: "leet" from index 0 to 3 and "code" from index 5 to 8. There is only 1 unused character (at index 4), so we return 1.

Example 2:

Input: s = "sayhelloworld", dictionary = ["hello","world"]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can break s in two substrings: "hello" from index 3 to 7 and "world" from index 8 to 12. The characters at indices 0, 1, 2 are not used in any substring and thus are considered as extra characters. Hence, we return 3.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 50
1 <= dictionary.length <= 50
1 <= dictionary[i].length <= 50
dictionary[i] and s consists of only lowercase English letters
dictionary contains distinct words
