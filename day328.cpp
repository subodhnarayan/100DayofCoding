Stock Buy and Sell â€“ Max 2 Transactions Allowed
Difficulty: HardAccuracy: 50.13%Submissions: 66K+Points: 8Average Time: 20m
In daily share trading, a trader buys shares and sells them on the same day. If the trader is allowed to make at most 2 transactions in a day, find out the maximum profit that a share trader could have made.

You are given an array prices[] representing stock prices throughout the day. Note that the second transaction can only start after the first one is complete (buy->sell->buy->sell).

Examples:

Input: prices[] = [10, 22, 5, 75, 65, 80]
Output: 87
Explanation: 
Trader will buy at 10 and sells at 22. 
Profit earned in 1st transaction = 22 - 10 = 12. 
Then he buys at 5 and sell at 80. 
Profit earned in 2nd transaction = 80 - 5 = 75. 
Total profit earned = 12 + 75 = 87. 
Input: prices[] = [2, 30, 15, 10, 8, 25, 80]
Output: 100
Explanation: 
Trader will buy at 2 and sells at 30. 
Profit earned in 1st transaction = 30 - 2 = 28. 
Then he buys at 8 and sell at 80. 
Profit earned in 2nd transaction = 80 - 8 = 72. 
Total profit earned = 28 + 72 = 100.
Constraints:
1 <= prices.size() <= 105
1 <= prices[i] <= 10

class Solution {
    public:
      int maxProfit(vector<int> &prices) {
          // code here
          vector<int>next(5),curr(5);
           int n=prices.size();
           for(int i=n-1;i>=0;i--){
               for(int j=3;j>=0;j--){
                   int profit=0;
                   if(j%2==0){
                       profit=max(-prices[i]+next[j+1],next[j]);
                   }
                   else{
                       profit=max(prices[i]+next[j+1],next[j]);
                   }
                   curr[j]=profit;
               }
               next=curr;
           }
           return next[0];
      }
  };

3108. Minimum Cost Walk in Weighted Graph
Solved
Hard
Topics
Companies
Hint
There is an undirected weighted graph with n vertices labeled from 0 to n - 1.

You are given the integer n and an array edges, where edges[i] = [ui, vi, wi] indicates that there is an edge between vertices ui and vi with a weight of wi.

A walk on a graph is a sequence of vertices and edges. The walk starts and ends with a vertex, and each edge connects the vertex that comes before it and the vertex that comes after it. It's important to note that a walk may visit the same edge or vertex more than once.

The cost of a walk starting at node u and ending at node v is defined as the bitwise AND of the weights of the edges traversed during the walk. In other words, if the sequence of edge weights encountered during the walk is w0, w1, w2, ..., wk, then the cost is calculated as w0 & w1 & w2 & ... & wk, where & denotes the bitwise AND operator.

You are also given a 2D array query, where query[i] = [si, ti]. For each query, you need to find the minimum cost of the walk starting at vertex si and ending at vertex ti. If there exists no such walk, the answer is -1.

Return the array answer, where answer[i] denotes the minimum cost of a walk for query i.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1,7],[1,3,7],[1,2,1]], query = [[0,3],[3,4]]

Output: [1,-1]

Explanation:


To achieve the cost of 1 in the first query, we need to move on the following edges: 0->1 (weight 7), 1->2 (weight 1), 2->1 (weight 1), 1->3 (weight 7).

In the second query, there is no walk between nodes 3 and 4, so the answer is -1.

Example 2:

Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,2,7],[0,1,15],[1,2,6],[1,2,1]], query = [[1,2]]

Output: [0]

Explanation:


To achieve the cost of 0 in the first query, we need to move on the following edges: 1->2 (weight 1), 2->1 (weight 6), 1->2 (weight 1).

 

Constraints:

2 <= n <= 105
0 <= edges.length <= 105
edges[i].length == 3
0 <= ui, vi <= n - 1
ui != vi
0 <= wi <= 105
1 <= query.length <= 105
query[i].length == 2
0 <= si, ti <= n - 1
si != ti
