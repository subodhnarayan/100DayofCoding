Difficulty: MediumAccuracy: 48.67%Submissions: 16K+Points: 4
Given an array arr[] of positive integers, your task is to find the maximum possible sum of all elements that are not part of the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS).

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [4, 6, 1, 2, 3, 8]
Output: 10
Explanation: The elements which are not in LIS is 4 and 6.
Input: arr[] = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
Output: 14
Explanation: The elements which are not in LIS is 5, 4, 3 and 2.
Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 103
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 105

Expected Complexities
Time Complexity: O(n log n)
Auxiliary Space: O(n)
