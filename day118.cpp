Find length of Loop
Difficulty: EasyAccuracy: 44.26%Submissions: 185K+Points: 2
Given the head of a linked list, determine whether the list contains a loop. If a loop is present, return the number of nodes in the loop, otherwise return 0.



Note: 'c' is the position of the node which is the next pointer of the last node of the linkedlist. If c is 0, then there is no loop.

Examples:

Input: LinkedList: 25->14->19->33->10->21->39->90->58->45, c = 4
Output: 7
Explanation: The loop is from 33 to 45. So length of loop is 33->10->21->39-> 90->58->45 = 7. 
The number 33 is connected to the last node of the linkedlist to form the loop because according to the input the 4th node from the beginning(1 based indexing) 
will be connected to the last node for the loop.
 
Input: LinkedList: 5->4, c = 0
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no loop.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= no. of nodes <= 106
0 <= node.data <=106
0 <= c<= n-1



class Solution {
  public:
    // Function to find the length of a loop in the linked list.
    int findLength(Node* slow, Node* fast){
    
    // count to keep track of 
    // nodes encountered in loop
    int cnt = 1;
    
    // move fast by one step
    fast = fast->next;
    
    // traverse fast till it 
    // reaches back to slow
    while(slow!=fast){
        
        // at each node increase
        // count by 1 and move fast
        // forward by one step
        cnt++;
        fast = fast->next;
    }
    
    // loop terminates when fast reaches
    // slow again and the count is returned
    return cnt;
}
    int countNodesinLoop(Node *head) {
       Node* slow = head;
    Node* fast = head;

    // Step 1: Traverse the list to detect a loop
    while (fast != nullptr && fast->next != nullptr) {
        // Move slow one step
        slow = slow->next;     
        // Move fast two steps
        fast = fast->next->next;

        // Step 2: If the slow and fast pointers
        // meet, there is a loop
        if (slow == fast) {
            // return the number of nodes
            // in the loop
            return findLength(slow, fast);
        }
    }

    // Step 3: If the fast pointer
    // reaches the end, there is no loop
    return 0; 
            
    }

947. Most Stones Removed with Same Row or Column
Solved
Medium
Topics
Companies
On a 2D plane, we place n stones at some integer coordinate points. Each coordinate point may have at most one stone.

A stone can be removed if it shares either the same row or the same column as another stone that has not been removed.

Given an array stones of length n where stones[i] = [xi, yi] represents the location of the ith stone, return the largest possible number of stones that can be removed.

 

Example 1:

Input: stones = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[1,2],[2,1],[2,2]]
Output: 5
Explanation: One way to remove 5 stones is as follows:
1. Remove stone [2,2] because it shares the same row as [2,1].
2. Remove stone [2,1] because it shares the same column as [0,1].
3. Remove stone [1,2] because it shares the same row as [1,0].
4. Remove stone [1,0] because it shares the same column as [0,0].
5. Remove stone [0,1] because it shares the same row as [0,0].
Stone [0,0] cannot be removed since it does not share a row/column with another stone still on the plane.
Example 2:

Input: stones = [[0,0],[0,2],[1,1],[2,0],[2,2]]
Output: 3
Explanation: One way to make 3 moves is as follows:
1. Remove stone [2,2] because it shares the same row as [2,0].
2. Remove stone [2,0] because it shares the same column as [0,0].
3. Remove stone [0,2] because it shares the same row as [0,0].
Stones [0,0] and [1,1] cannot be removed since they do not share a row/column with another stone still on the plane.
Example 3:

Input: stones = [[0,0]]
Output: 0
Explanation: [0,0] is the only stone on the plane, so you cannot remove it.
 

Constraints:

1 <= stones.length <= 1000
0 <= xi, yi <= 104
No two stones are at the same coordinate point.
