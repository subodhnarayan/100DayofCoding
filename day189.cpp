Minimum repeat to make substring
Difficulty: MediumAccuracy: 51.22%Submissions: 56K+Points: 4
Given two strings s1 and s2. Return a minimum number of times s1 has to be repeated such that s2 is a substring of it. If s2 can never be a substring then return -1.

Note: Both the strings contain only lowercase letters.

Examples:

Input: s1 = "ww", s2 = "www"
Output: 2
Explanation: Repeating s1 two times (wwww), s2 is a substring of it.
Input: s1 = "abcd", s2 = "cdabcdab" 
Output: 3 
Explanation: Repeating s1 three times (abcdabcdabcd), s2 is a substring of it. s2 is not a substring of s2 when it is repeated less than 3 times.
Input: s1 = "ab", s2 = "cab"
Output: -1
Explanation: No matter how many times we repeat s1, we can't get a string such that s2 is a substring of it.
Constraints:
1 ≤ |s1|, |s2| ≤ 105

class Solution {
  public:
    int minRepeats(string& s1, string& s2) {
        // code here
          int ans = 1 , n1 = s1.size() ;string s = s1;
        while(n1<s2.size()){
            ans++;
            n1+=s1.size();
            s+=s1;
        }
        if(s.find(s2)!=string::npos)return ans;
        ans++;
        s+=s1;
        if(s.find(s2)!=string::npos)return ans;
        return -1;
    }

Hint
You are given a sorted array nums of n non-negative integers and an integer maximumBit. You want to perform the following query n times:

Find a non-negative integer k < 2maximumBit such that nums[0] XOR nums[1] XOR ... XOR nums[nums.length-1] XOR k is maximized. k is the answer to the ith query.
Remove the last element from the current array nums.
Return an array answer, where answer[i] is the answer to the ith query.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [0,1,1,3], maximumBit = 2
Output: [0,3,2,3]
Explanation: The queries are answered as follows:
1st query: nums = [0,1,1,3], k = 0 since 0 XOR 1 XOR 1 XOR 3 XOR 0 = 3.
2nd query: nums = [0,1,1], k = 3 since 0 XOR 1 XOR 1 XOR 3 = 3.
3rd query: nums = [0,1], k = 2 since 0 XOR 1 XOR 2 = 3.
4th query: nums = [0], k = 3 since 0 XOR 3 = 3.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,3,4,7], maximumBit = 3
Output: [5,2,6,5]
Explanation: The queries are answered as follows:
1st query: nums = [2,3,4,7], k = 5 since 2 XOR 3 XOR 4 XOR 7 XOR 5 = 7.
2nd query: nums = [2,3,4], k = 2 since 2 XOR 3 XOR 4 XOR 2 = 7.
3rd query: nums = [2,3], k = 6 since 2 XOR 3 XOR 6 = 7.
4th query: nums = [2], k = 5 since 2 XOR 5 = 7.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [0,1,2,2,5,7], maximumBit = 3
Output: [4,3,6,4,6,7]
 

Constraints:

nums.length == n
1 <= n <= 105
1 <= maximumBit <= 20
0 <= nums[i] < 2maximumBit
nums​​​ is sorted in ascending order.
