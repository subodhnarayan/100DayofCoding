Missing in Array
Difficulty: EasyAccuracy: 29.59%Submissions: 1.4MPoints: 2Average Time: 15m
You are given an array arr[] of size n - 1 that contains distinct integers in the range from 1 to n (inclusive). This array represents a permutation of the integers from 1 to n with one element missing. Your task is to identify and return the missing element.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 5]
Output: 4
Explanation: All the numbers from 1 to 5 are present except 4.
Input: arr[] = [8, 2, 4, 5, 3, 7, 1]
Output: 6
Explanation: All the numbers from 1 to 8 are present except 6.
Input: arr[] = [1]
Output: 2
Explanation: Only 1 is present so the missing element is 2.
Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 106
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ arr.size() + 1

Expected Complexities
Time Complexity: O(n)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)

class Solution {
    public:
      int missingNum(vector<int>& arr) {
          // code here
          long long int n=arr.size();
          long long int total=((n+1)*(n+2))/2;
          long long int sum=0;
          for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
          {
              sum+=arr[i];
          }
          long long int ans = total-sum;
          return ans;
      }
  };

2145. Count the Hidden Sequences

Hint
You are given a 0-indexed array of n integers differences, which describes the differences between each pair of consecutive integers of a hidden sequence of length (n + 1). More formally, call the hidden sequence hidden, then we have that differences[i] = hidden[i + 1] - hidden[i].

You are further given two integers lower and upper that describe the inclusive range of values [lower, upper] that the hidden sequence can contain.

For example, given differences = [1, -3, 4], lower = 1, upper = 6, the hidden sequence is a sequence of length 4 whose elements are in between 1 and 6 (inclusive).
[3, 4, 1, 5] and [4, 5, 2, 6] are possible hidden sequences.
[5, 6, 3, 7] is not possible since it contains an element greater than 6.
[1, 2, 3, 4] is not possible since the differences are not correct.
Return the number of possible hidden sequences there are. If there are no possible sequences, return 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: differences = [1,-3,4], lower = 1, upper = 6
Output: 2
Explanation: The possible hidden sequences are:
- [3, 4, 1, 5]
- [4, 5, 2, 6]
Thus, we return 2.
Example 2:

Input: differences = [3,-4,5,1,-2], lower = -4, upper = 5
Output: 4
Explanation: The possible hidden sequences are:
- [-3, 0, -4, 1, 2, 0]
- [-2, 1, -3, 2, 3, 1]
- [-1, 2, -2, 3, 4, 2]
- [0, 3, -1, 4, 5, 3]
Thus, we return 4.
Example 3:

Input: differences = [4,-7,2], lower = 3, upper = 6
Output: 0
Explanation: There are no possible hidden sequences. Thus, we return 0.
 

Constraints:

n == differences.length
1 <= n <= 105
-105 <= differences[i] <= 105
-105 <= lower <= upper <= 105
