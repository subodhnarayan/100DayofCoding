Find rectangle with corners as 1
Difficulty: MediumAccuracy: 56.75%Submissions: 16K+Points: 4
Given an n x m binary matrix mat[][] containing only 0s and 1s, determine if there exists a rectangle within the matrix such that all four corners of the rectangle are 1. If such a rectangle exists, return true; otherwise, return false.

Example:

Input: mat[][] =
[[1, 0, 0, 1, 0],
[0, 0, 1, 0, 1],
[0, 0, 0, 1, 0], 
[1, 0, 1, 0, 1]] 
Output: true
Explanation: Valid corners are at index (1,2), (1,4), (3,2), (3,4) 
Input: mat[][] =
[[0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are no valid corners.
Constraints:
1 <= n, m <= 200
0 <= mat[i] <= 1

Expected Complexities
Time Complexity: O(n * (m^2))
Auxiliary Space: O(n)

class Solution {
  public:
    bool ValidCorner(vector<vector<int> >& a) {
        // code here
        int n=a.size();
        int m=a[0].size();
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            for(int j=i+1;j<n;j++){
                int temp=0;
                for(int k=0;k<m;k++){
                    if(a[i][k]&&a[j][k])temp++;
                }
                if(temp>=2) return true;
            }
        }
        
        return false;
    }
};

Hint
There exist two undirected trees with n and m nodes, with distinct labels in ranges [0, n - 1] and [0, m - 1], respectively.

You are given two 2D integer arrays edges1 and edges2 of lengths n - 1 and m - 1, respectively, where edges1[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the first tree and edges2[i] = [ui, vi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ui and vi in the second tree. You are also given an integer k.

Node u is target to node v if the number of edges on the path from u to v is less than or equal to k. Note that a node is always target to itself.

Return an array of n integers answer, where answer[i] is the maximum possible number of nodes target to node i of the first tree if you have to connect one node from the first tree to another node in the second tree.

Note that queries are independent from each other. That is, for every query you will remove the added edge before proceeding to the next query.

 

Example 1:

Input: edges1 = [[0,1],[0,2],[2,3],[2,4]], edges2 = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[2,7],[1,4],[4,5],[4,6]], k = 2

Output: [9,7,9,8,8]

Explanation:

For i = 0, connect node 0 from the first tree to node 0 from the second tree.
For i = 1, connect node 1 from the first tree to node 0 from the second tree.
For i = 2, connect node 2 from the first tree to node 4 from the second tree.
For i = 3, connect node 3 from the first tree to node 4 from the second tree.
For i = 4, connect node 4 from the first tree to node 4 from the second tree.

Example 2:

Input: edges1 = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[0,4]], edges2 = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3]], k = 1

Output: [6,3,3,3,3]

Explanation:

For every i, connect node i of the first tree with any node of the second tree.


 

Constraints:

2 <= n, m <= 1000
edges1.length == n - 1
edges2.length == m - 1
edges1[i].length == edges2[i].length == 2
edges1[i] = [ai, bi]
0 <= ai, bi < n
edges2[i] = [ui, vi]
0 <= ui, vi < m
The input is generated such that edges1 and edges2 represent valid trees.
0 <= k <= 1000

public:
    int dfs(int node, int parent, const vector<vector<int>>& children, int k) {
        if (k < 0) {

        }
        int res = 1;
        for (int child : children[node]) {
            if (child == parent) {
                continue;
            }
            res += dfs(child, node, children, k - 1);
        }
        return res;
    }

    vector<int> build(const vector<vector<int>>& edges, int k) {
        int n = edges.size() + 1;
        vector<vector<int>> children(n);
        for (const auto& edge : edges) {
            children[edge[0]].push_back(edge[1]);
            children[edge[1]].push_back(edge[0]);
        }
        vector<int> res(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            res[i] = dfs(i, -1, children, k);
        }
        return res;
    }

    vector<int> maxTargetNodes(vector<vector<int>>& edges1,
                               vector<vector<int>>& edges2, int k) {
        int n = edges1.size() + 1, m = edges2.size() + 1;
        vector<int> count1 = build(edges1, k);
        vector<int> count2 = build(edges2, k - 1);
        int maxCount2 = *max_element(count2.begin(), count2.end());
        vector<int> res(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            res[i] = count1[i] + maxCount2;
        }
        return res;
    }
