Array to BST
Difficulty: EasyAccuracy: 46.02%Submissions: 74K+Points: 2
Given a sorted array. Convert it into a Height Balanced Binary Search Tree (BST). Return the root of the BST.

Height-balanced BST means a binary tree in which the depth of the left subtree and the right subtree of every node never differ by more than 1.

Note: The driver code will check the BST, if it is a Height-balanced BST, the output will be true otherwise the output will be false.

Examples :

Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: true
Explanation: The preorder traversal of the following BST formed is [2, 1, 3, 4]:
           2
         /   \
        1     3
               \
                4
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
Ouput: true
Explanation: The preorder traversal of the following BST formed is [4, 2, 1, 3, 6, 5, 7]:
        4
       / \
      2   6
     / \   / \
    1 3  5 7
Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxillary Space: O(n)

Constraints:
1 ≤ nums.size() ≤ 105
1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 105


class Solution {
  public:
  Node* help(vector<int> & nums,int start,int end){
      if(start>end){
          return NULL;
      }
      int mid=(start+end)/2;
      Node* root=new Node(nums[mid]);
      root->left=help(nums,start,mid-1);
      root->right=help(nums,mid+1,end);
      return root;
  }
    Node* sortedArrayToBST(vector<int>& nums) {
        int start=0;
        int end=nums.size()-1;
        return help(nums,start,end);
    }

Given an array of integers nums, sort the array in ascending order and return it.

You must solve the problem without using any built-in functions in O(nlog(n)) time complexity and with the smallest space complexity possible.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [5,2,3,1]
Output: [1,2,3,5]
Explanation: After sorting the array, the positions of some numbers are not changed (for example, 2 and 3), while the positions of other numbers are changed (for example, 1 and 5).
Example 2:

Input: nums = [5,1,1,2,0,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,5]
Explanation: Note that the values of nums are not necessairly unique.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 104
-5 * 104 <= nums[i] <= 5 * 104
