Given an array of integers arr[] where, every element appears thrice except for one which occurs once.
Find that element which occurs once.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 10, 1, 1]
Output: 10
Explanation: 10 occurs once in the array while the other element 1 occurs thrice.
Input: arr[] = [3, 2, 1, 34, 34, 1, 2, 34, 2, 1]
Output: 3
Explanation: All elements except 3 occurs thrice in the array.
Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
arr.size() % 3 = 1
-109 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 109

Expected Complexities
Time Complexity: O(n)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)
