Alternative Sorting
Difficulty: BasicAccuracy: 50.2%Submissions: 37K+Points: 1
Given an array arr of distinct integers. Rearrange the array in such a way that the first element is the largest and the second element is the smallest, the third element is the second largest and the fourth element is the second smallest, and so on.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
Output: [7, 1, 6, 2, 5, 3, 4]
Explanation: The first element is first maximum and second element is first minimum and so on.
Input: arr[] = [1, 6, 9, 4, 3, 7, 8, 2]
Output: [9, 1, 8, 2, 7, 3, 6, 4]
Explanation: The first element is first maximum and second element is first minimum and so on.
Expected Time Complexity: O(nlogn).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n).

Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 105

1233. Remove Sub-Folders from the Filesystem
Solved

Topics
Companies
Hint
Given a list of folders folder, return the folders after removing all sub-folders in those folders. You may return the answer in any order.

If a folder[i] is located within another folder[j], it is called a sub-folder of it. A sub-folder of folder[j] must start with folder[j], followed by a "/". For example, "/a/b" is a sub-folder of "/a", but "/b" is not a sub-folder of "/a/b/c".

The format of a path is one or more concatenated strings of the form: '/' followed by one or more lowercase English letters.

For example, "/leetcode" and "/leetcode/problems" are valid paths while an empty string and "/" are not.
 

Example 1:

Input: folder = ["/a","/a/b","/c/d","/c/d/e","/c/f"]
Output: ["/a","/c/d","/c/f"]
Explanation: Folders "/a/b" is a subfolder of "/a" and "/c/d/e" is inside of folder "/c/d" in our filesystem.
Example 2:

Input: folder = ["/a","/a/b/c","/a/b/d"]
Output: ["/a"]
Explanation: Folders "/a/b/c" and "/a/b/d" will be removed because they are subfolders of "/a".
Example 3:

Input: folder = ["/a/b/c","/a/b/ca","/a/b/d"]
Output: ["/a/b/c","/a/b/ca","/a/b/d"]
 

Constraints:

1 <= folder.length <= 4 * 104
2 <= folder[i].length <= 100
folder[i] contains only lowercase letters and '/'.
folder[i] always starts with the character '/'.
Each folder name is unique.
