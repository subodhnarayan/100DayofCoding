0 - 1 Knapsack Problem
Difficulty: MediumAccuracy: 31.76%Submissions: 471K+Points: 4
Given n items, each with a specific weight and value, and a knapsack with a capacity of W, the task is to put the items in the knapsack such that the sum of weights of the items <= W and the sum of values associated with them is maximized. 

Note: You can either place an item entirely in the bag or leave it out entirely. Also, each item is available in single quantity.

Examples :

Input: W = 4, val[] = [1, 2, 3], wt[] = [4, 5, 1] 
Output: 3
Explanation: Choose the last item, which weighs 1 unit and has a value of 3.
Input: W = 3, val[] = [1, 2, 3], wt[] = [4, 5, 6] 
Output: 0
Explanation: Every item has a weight exceeding the knapsack's capacity (3).
Input: W = 5, val[] = [10, 40, 30, 50], wt[] = [5, 4, 2, 3] 
Output: 80
Explanation: Choose the third item (value 30, weight 2) and the last item (value 50, weight 3) for a total value of 80.
Constraints:
2 ≤ val.size() = wt.size() ≤ 103
1 ≤ W ≤ 103
1 ≤ val[i] ≤ 103
1 ≤ wt[i] ≤ 103
