Difficulty: MediumAccuracy: 20.06%Submissions: 233K+Points: 4Average Time: 20m
Given two numbers as strings s1 and s2. Calculate their Product.
Note: The numbers can be negative and You are not allowed to use any built-in function or convert the strings to integers. There can be zeros in the begining of the numbers. You don't need to specify '+' sign in the begining of positive numbers.

Examples:

Input: s1 = "0033", s2 = "2"
Output: "66"
Explanation: 33 * 2 = 66
Input: s1 = "11", s2 = "23"
Output: "253"
Explanation: 11 * 23  = 253
Input: s1 = "123", s2 = "0"
Output: "0"
Explanation: Anything multiplied by 0 is equal to 0.
Constraints:
1 ≤ s1.size() ≤ 103
1 ≤ s2.size() ≤ 103

Expected Complexities
Time Complexity: O(n * m)
Auxiliary Space: O(n * m)
