Difficulty: MediumAccuracy: 47.26%Submissions: 34K+Points: 4
Given a preorder traversal of a BST, find the leaf nodes of the tree without building the tree.


Examples:

Input: preorder[] = [5, 2, 10]
Output: [2, 10]
Explaination: 

2 and 10 are the leaf nodes as shown in the figure.
Input: preorder[] = [4, 2, 1, 3, 6, 5]
Output: [1, 3, 5]
Explaination: 

1, 3 and 5 are the leaf nodes as shown in the figure.
Input: preorder[] = [8, 2, 5, 10, 12]
Output: [5, 12]
Explaination: 

5 and 12 are the leaf nodes as shown in the figure.

Constraints:
1 ≤ preorder.size() ≤ 103
1 ≤ preorder[i] ≤ 103

Expected Complexities
Time Complexity: O(n)
Auxiliary Space: O(n)
