Clone List with Next and Random
Difficulty: HardAccuracy: 64.8%Submissions: 103K+Points: 8
You are given a special linked list with n nodes where each node has two pointers a next pointer that points to the next node of the singly linked list, and a random pointer that points to the random node of the linked list.

Construct a copy of this linked list. The copy should consist of the same number of new nodes, where each new node has the value corresponding to its original node. Both the next and random pointer of the new nodes should point to new nodes in the copied list, such that it also represent the same list state. None of the pointers in the new list should point to nodes in the original list.

Return the head of the copied linked list.

NOTE : Original linked list should remain unchanged.

Examples:

Input: head = [[1, 3], [3, 3], [5, NULL], [9, 3]] 
      
Output: head = [[1, 3], [3, 3], [5, NULL], [9, 3]] 
Explanation: 
Node 1 points to Node 2 as its NEXT and Node 3 as its RANDOM.
Node 2 points to Node 3 as its NEXT and Node 3 as its RANDOM.
Node 3 points to Node 4 as its NEXT and NULL as its RANDOM.
Node 4 points to NULL as its NEXT and Node 3 as its RANDOM.
Input: head = [[1, 3], [2, 1], [3, 5], [4, 3], [5, 2]]
  
 
Output: head = [[1, 3], [2, 1], [3, 5], [4, 3], [5, 2]]
Explanation: 
Node 1 points to Node 2 as its NEXT and Node 3 as its RANDOM.
Node 2 points to Node 3 as its NEXT and Node 1 as its RANDOM.
Node 3 points to Node 4 as its NEXT and Node 5 as its RANDOM.
Node 4 points to Node 5 as its NEXT and Node 3 as its RANDOM.
Node 5 points to NULL as its NEXT and Node 2 as its RANDOM.
Input: head = [[7, NULL], [7, NULL]]
Output: head = [[7, NULL], [7, NULL]]
Explanation: 
Node 1 points to Node 2 as its NEXT and NULL as its RANDOM.
Node 2 points to NULL as its NEXT and NULL as its RANDOM.
Constraints:
1 <= n <= 100
0 <= node->data <= 1000

1267. Count Servers that Communicate
Solved
Medium
Topics
Companies
Hint
You are given a map of a server center, represented as a m * n integer matrix grid, where 1 means that on that cell there is a server and 0 means that it is no server. Two servers are said to communicate if they are on the same row or on the same column.

Return the number of servers that communicate with any other server.

 

Example 1:



Input: grid = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: 0
Explanation: No servers can communicate with others.
Example 2:



Input: grid = [[1,0],[1,1]]
Output: 3
Explanation: All three servers can communicate with at least one other server.
Example 3:



Input: grid = [[1,1,0,0],[0,0,1,0],[0,0,1,0],[0,0,0,1]]
Output: 4
Explanation: The two servers in the first row can communicate with each other. The two servers in the third column can communicate with each other. The server at right bottom corner can't communicate with any other server.
 

Constraints:

m == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= m <= 250
1 <= n <= 250
grid[i][j] == 0 or 1



class Solution {
public:
    int countServers(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        vector<int> Rows(grid.size());
        vector<int> Col(grid[0].size());
        
        // Calculate row and column sums
        for (int i = 0; i < grid.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].size(); j++) {
                Rows[i] += grid[i][j];
                Col[j] += grid[i][j];
            }
        }
        
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < grid.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].size(); j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1 && (Rows[i] > 1 || Col[j] > 1)) {
                    ans++;
                }
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
